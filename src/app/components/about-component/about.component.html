  <p>The family beeing splitted across the world, it is not easy to keep in touch<br>
    with relatives. Of course we usually know our close family, some of our direct cousins,<br>
    but that's about it. When it comes to second cousins, we marely know how we are related.</p>
  
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this website is to learn about our genealogy. The aim is to collaborate,<br>
    to build the family tree so it can be usefull for the next generation.</p>
  
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>I tried some tools available on the market to build family trees, but didn't find anything<br>
    that fits what I was expecting. Something easy to use and accessible to everyone.</p>
  
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <p>- Family Tree and user information<br>
    - Photos<br>
    <br>
    In the future, it would be interesting to have some features like messaging,<br>
    contact infos, birthday reminders, GEDCOM generation ...</p>
  
  <h3>Keywords</h3>
  <p>ancestry, genetics, lineage, descent, generation, heredity, history, line, parentage blood line, progeniture,<br>
    clan, folk, group, house, household, people, tribe, ancestors, birth, children, descendants, descent, dynasty,<br>
    generations, in-laws, network, pedigree, progenitors, progeny, relations, relationship,<br>
    relatives, siblings</p>
  
  <h3>Data privacy</h3>
  <p>For the moment, all information are public. Except dates, places and contact infos, that are<br>
    only availble to connected users.<br>
